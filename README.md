This repository displays my solutions to the coding exercises within the course "Statistical Learning Thoery" at ETH ZÃ¼rich, spring 2024. A compilation of the topics is found below.

| # | Topic | Description |
|--------------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Sampling | MCMC-based simulating algrotihms (Metropolis algorithm and simulated annealing) applied to image recunstruction problem (via Ising model) and travelling salesman problem. |
| 2 | Histogram clustering | Unsupervised image segmentation using histrogram clustering, akin to [ref](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/784981). |
| 3 | Constance shift embedding | Clustering of non-metric data, via embedding into euclidean space. This is applied to characterize community members based on email correspondences. |
| 4 | Model validation | An information theoretic approach to model validation is employed. This is applied to the approxiamte sorting algorithm in this [original paper](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-642-40602-7).|
